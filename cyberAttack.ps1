    Infection Monkey is an open source security tool for testing a data centers resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection.
    The Monkey uses various methods to self propagate across a data center and reports success to a centralized Monkey Island server.

    The Infection Monkey is comprised of two parts:
    1. Monkey - A tool which infects other machines and propagates to them.
    2. Monkey Island - A dedicated server to control and visualize the Infection Monkeys progress inside the data center.

    The Infection Monkey uses the following techniques and exploits to propagate to other machines:
        
    1. Multiple propagation techniques:
       - Predefined passwords
       - Common logical exploits
       - Password stealing using Mimikatz
        
    2. Multiple exploit methods:
       - SSH
       - SMB
       - WMI
       - Shellshock
       - Conficker
       - SambaCry
       - Elastic Search (CVE-2015-1427)

        Vulmap
        ------
        
        Online local vulnerability scanner for installed software,
        and then search for any existing exploites to the software in http://vulmon.com API.
       
        The script will run on all machines found in the Active Directory of the domain.
              
        All found exploits can be downloaded by Vulmap using this command:
        Invoke-Vulmap -DownloadAllExploits

    #cmdkey
    3 {
       $help = @"

        cmdkey
        ------
        
        Cmdkey is a pre-installed Windows tool, It’s essentially a credential manager,
        and these credentials are stored by default in:
        C:\users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\
       
       Cmdkey can store two types of password. The first is a generic password which can be used anywhere,
       and the second a domain password which can be used to access a domain server.

       Stored credentials can be leveraged to type the contents of files and run executables with the same 
       privileges as the credentials stored.

       The script will collect information from all machines found in the Active Directory of the domain.

       Howto utilize the attack:
       runas /savecred /user:Domain\Administrator "\\<Computer>\<share>\<evilApp.exe>
