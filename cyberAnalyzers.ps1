        Process NTDS/SYSTEM files and export pwdump/ophcrack files using NtdsAudit and
        DSINternals tools.

        NtdsAudit is an application to assist in auditing Active Directory databases,        
        and provides some useful statistics relating to accounts and passwords.

        DSinternals is a Directory Services Internals PowerShell Module and Framework.
        we will use the Get-ADDBAccount function retrieve accounts from an Active Directory database file
        and dump the users password hashes to Ophcrack, HashcatNT, HashcatLM, JohnNT and JohnLM formats.

        Both tools requires the ntds.dit Active Directory database, and optionally the 
        SYSTEM registry hive if dumping password hashes

        Ophcrack
        --------

        Ophcrack is a free Windows password cracker based on rainbow tables.
        It is a very efficient implementation of rainbow tables done by the inventors of the method

        - Cracks LM and NTLM hashes
        - Free tables available
        - Brute-force module for simple passwords
        - Audit mode and CSV export
        - Real-time graphs to analyze the passwords
        - Dumps and loads hashes from encrypted SAM recovered from a Windows partition

        In order to run the hashed passwords cracking process, we will upload the
        $ACQ\hashes-Ophcrack.txt into ophcrack.
       
        Next step you will need to Press the [Crack] button to start the process.

        ----------

        visualising attack paths using graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships
        within an Active Directory environment and dentify highly complex attack paths.

        Data Includes:
        - Users         – The users on the network extracted from active directory
        - Computers     – The different endpoints on the network, servers, workstations and other devices
        - Groups        – The different AD groups extracted from AD
        - Sessions      – The amount of user sessions on computers on the network that the ingestor has extracted
        - ACLs          – Access control lists, the different permissions and access that users and groups have against each other
        - Relationships – The different relations that all of the other aspects have to each other such as 
                          group memberships, users, user sessions and other related information

        Please wait untill the neo4j database is running, this can take some time,
        on 1st run you need to change the default login password in the neo4j web interface:
        User:     neo4j
        password: neo4j (change this to BloodHound)

        Bloodhound application login will be:
        User:    neo4j

        ------------

        Application Inspector's primary objective is to identify source code features in a systematic and scalable way 
        not found elsewhere in typical static analyzers. This enables developer and security professionals to validate 
        purported component objectives.

        Application Inspector will scan projects with supported languages including projects with mixed languages 
        i.e. those that contain multiple languages in the same directory or sub-directories for well-known identifying features.

        more information:
        https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInspector/wiki

        Steps:
        ------
        1. Compress the content of the source code
        2. Browse and select the source code compressed file
        3. The analyze process will start automatically
        4. Review the report that will be shown in your browser

        requirements: Active Directory server 

        Option 1 - mounting ntds.dit remotely on the Domain server
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        The script will copy the ntds.dit to the domain controller 
        and try to mout it using dsamain.exe command

        Steps:
        1- Browse and Choose the ntds.dit file to load
        2- Check ntds.dit integrity
        3- Upgrade the ntds.dit database      
        4- Run the AD on port 10389
        5- Get the domain name from the mounted database
        6- Browse the AD using the sysinternals tool adexplorer (connect to $AD port 10389)

        Option 2 - mounting ntds.dit directly on the Domain server
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        run this script directly on the domain server

        $upg = "dsamain.exe /dbpath <path to ntds.dit> /ldapport 10389  /allowupgrade"

        Running Sharphound on mounted AD
        --------------------------------
        Import-Module SharpHound.ps1
        Invoke-BloodHound -DomainController <server name or IP> -LdapPort 10389 -Domain <full Domain name of the organization>

        (BloodHound needs the net-sessions in order to create the attack paths, so offline is not that relevant :-)

        Running pingcastle on mounted AD
        --------------------------------               
        pingCastle --no-enum-limit --carto --healthcheck --server <server name or ip> --port 10389
        pingCastle --hc-conso

        (pingcastle needs the SYSVOL from the original domain in order to create the complete report)
